## Welcome to My VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Journey

This is Week 0 — environment setup, tool installation, and an overview of the SoC tapeout flow.

## Week 0 Objectives
- Understand tapeout flow & program structure
- Install and verify open-source EDA tools
- Create a dedicated GitHub repo for documentation
- Capture learnings day-by-day

## ✅ Tasks Completed

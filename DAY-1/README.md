# **Day 1: Kickstart Your RTL Journey ‚Äì Verilog, Simulation & Synthesis**

Welcome to **Day 1** of the RTL Workshop! üéâ  
Today marks the beginning of an exciting journey into **digital design**, where I‚Äôll learn how to **describe, test, and synthesize digital circuits** using Verilog. We‚Äôll explore open-source simulation with **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** and get a sneak peek at **Yosys**, the tool that transforms your Verilog code into real hardware blueprints. Throughout this workshop, you‚Äôll not just read theory‚Äîyou‚Äôll **write code, run simulations, analyze circuits, and even perform logic synthesis**, giving you a solid, hands-on foundation in RTL design. By the end of today, you‚Äôll feel confident taking a simple Verilog design and seeing it come alive, from simulation waveforms to gate-level netlists! üöÄ

## 1. What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?

### **Simulator**  
Think of a **simulator** as your circuit‚Äôs ‚Äúplayground.‚Äù It allows you to **test your design in a virtual environment**, apply inputs, and observe outputs‚Äîwithout touching a single physical wire. This is your first step to **catching bugs early** and understanding how your circuit behaves.

### **Design**  
The **design** is the heart of your digital circuit. This is your **Verilog code**, describing how logic gates and flip-flops work together to perform a task.

### **Testbench**  
A **testbench** is like your circuit‚Äôs personal trainer. It **applies various inputs** to your design and checks if the outputs behave as expected. Without a testbench, you‚Äôre basically flying blind!

## 2. Getting Started with Icarus Verilog

**Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** is an open-source simulator that lets you **run and verify your Verilog designs**.  

Here‚Äôs how the simulation flow works:

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ca190fb-cfa4-4abb-b9e1-0151b3c4bdba" alt="iverilog Simulation Flow" width="70%">
</div>

- You provide **both your design and testbench** to iverilog.  
- The simulator executes your code and produces a **`.vcd` waveform file**.  
- You can then open this file in **GTKWave** to visually inspect your signals and verify functionality.  

Simulation is **fun and satisfying**‚Äîit‚Äôs like watching your digital circuit ‚Äúcome alive‚Äù on screen! üåü

## 3. Lab: Simulating a 2-to-1 Multiplexer

Let‚Äôs get our hands dirty with a **simple 2-to-1 multiplexer**!  

### **Step 1: Clone the Workshop Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```


 ###  Step 2: Install Required Tools

```shell
sudo apt install iverilog
sudo apt install gtkwave
```

###  Step 3: Simulate the Design

Compile the design and testbench:

```shell
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```
Run the simulation:

```shell
./a.out
```

View the waveform:

```shell
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

## 4. Verilog Code Analysis

**The code for the multiplexer (`good_mux.v`):**

```verilog
module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
    if(sel)
        y <= i1;
    else 
        y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```

###  **How It Works**

- **Inputs:** `i0`, `i1` (data), `sel` (select line)
- **Output:** `y` (registered output)
- **Logic:** If `sel` is 1, `y` gets `i1`; if `sel` is 0, `y` gets `i0`.

## 5. Introduction to Yosys & Gate Libraries

### What is Yosys?

Yosys is a powerful, open-source synthesis tool that converts your Verilog design into a gate-level netlist‚Äîessentially a blueprint for real hardware.

### üîπ Why Do Libraries Have Different Gate "Flavors"?

A .lib file isn‚Äôt just a single version of a gate‚Äîit‚Äôs a collection of gate variants, each designed for specific trade-offs. Different gates in a library help the synthesis tool choose the best fit for your circuit‚Äôs needs. Here‚Äôs what they offer:

‚ö° **Performance:** Fast gates for timing-critical paths, slower ones for energy efficiency

üîã **Power:** Low-power gates to save energy and reduce heat

üèóÔ∏è **Area:** Compact gates to make your chip smaller and more efficient

üí™ **Drive Strength:** Strong gates to drive larger loads or multiple signals

üåê **Signal Integrity:** Specialized gates to maintain clean signals in noisy environments

üß© **Mapping Flexibility:** Synthesis tools pick the most suitable ‚Äúflavor‚Äù for your design goals

Think of it like choosing the right ingredient for a recipe‚Äîsome are faster, some are lighter, some are stronger‚Äîbut together they make the perfect dish! üç≤‚ú®

    ```

3. **Read the Verilog code**
    ```shell
    read_verilog /home/vsduser/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/good_mux.v
    ```

4. **Synthesize the design**
    ```shell
    synth -top good_mux
    ```

5. **Technology mapping**

    ```

    ```shell
    show

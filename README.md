# SOC_TAPEOUT_WEEK1
# 🚀 SOC_TAPEOUT_WEEK1  

Welcome to the **RTL Workshop** – a hands-on learning series focused on Verilog RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and digital circuit optimization.  
This repository is organized into multiple days, each with practical labs, code examples, and explanations to make learning **fun and structured**.

## 📘 About This Workshop  

This workshop is designed for **students, hobbyists, and engineers** who want to dive into:  

- Verilog RTL design and simulation  
- Using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave** for simulation & waveform analysis  
- Logic synthesis with **Yosys** and the **SKY130 open-source PDK**  
- Key digital design concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, flip-flop coding styles, and optimization  

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites  

To get the best learning experience, you should have:  

- Basic knowledge of **digital logic** (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.)  
- Familiarity with **Linux shell commands**  
- A **Linux/WSL** environment (Windows/macOS users can use WSL)  
- Installed tools:  
  - `git`  
  - `iverilog`  
  - `gtkwave`  
  - `yosys`  
  - Any text editor (VS Code recommended ✅)
